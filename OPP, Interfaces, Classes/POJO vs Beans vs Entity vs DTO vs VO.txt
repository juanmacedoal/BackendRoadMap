DTO - Data transfer objects are just data containers which are used to transport data between layers and tiers.

- It mainly contains attributes. You can even use public attributes without getters and setters.
- Data transfer objects do not contain any business logic.

DTO was mainly used to get data transported across the network efficiently, it may be even from JVM to another JVM.

DTOs are often java.io.Serializable - in order to transfer data across JVM.

VO - A Value Object [1][2] represents itself a fixed set of data and is similar to a Java enum.
A Value Object's identity is based on their state rather than on their object identity and is immutable. 
A real world example would be Color.RED, Color.BLUE, SEX.FEMALE etc.

Java Beans - are reusable software components for Java that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool. 
Practically, they are classes written in the Java programming language conforming to a particular convention. 
They are used to encapsulate many objects into a single object (the bean), so that they can be passed around as 
a single bean object instead of as multiple individual objects. A JavaBean is a Java Object that is serializable, 
has a nullary constructor, and allows access to properties using getter and setter methods.

Conventions that java beans has to follow:

- The class must have a public default constructor. This allows easy instantiation within editing and activation frameworks.
- The class properties must be accessible using get, set, and other methods (so-called accessor methods and mutator methods), 
following a standard naming convention. This allows easy automated inspection and updating of bean state within frameworks, 
many of which include custom editors for various types of properties.
- The class should be serializable. This allows applications and frameworks to reliably save, store, and restore the bean's 
state in a fashion that is independent of the VM and platform.

Entity - refer to units of composition of the overall system data. They normally represent business objects like: bank 
accounts, employees, products, etc. They can be used to persist the state of the system to a database. A class that
is mapped to table.
